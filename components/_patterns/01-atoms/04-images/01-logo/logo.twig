/**
 * Available variables:
 * Many of the variables in this file are defined with defaults that make sense to this component
 * You can still override them when including this file in other components.
 *
 * - logo_blockname - default is 'logo' to produce the class "logo__link"
 *   becuase this is the same variable as the img blockname, the two will stay in sync
 * - logo_url - default is '/' to link to the homepage
 *   this is overridden in the logo.yml file to show (only in Pattern Lab) that overrides do work
 *   delete the logo_url definition from logo.yml to see the default take effect
 *
 * Defined blocks:
 * - link_content - replaces the link_content block of the link component
 *   Available variables in this block
 *   - logo_blockname - default is 'logo' to produce the class "logo__img"
 *     becuase this is the same variable as the link blockname, the two will stay in sync
 *   - logo_src - defaults to the logo.png file in the themeroot/components/images directory
 *   - logo_alt - defaults to 'Logo'
